# JavaTextEditor
A Java Swing Notepad-like text editor

Current features include style customization
as well as typical features found in a text editor.

As of right now, users can choose from a variety of installed
fonts as the current font as well as pick the current size.
For users that prefer the dark theme, there is a color palette inversion
set up. Lastly word wrapping can be disabled or enabled at a users
convencience. 


Additional tools have been developed. The first tool developed was
the ability to encrypt and decrypt the text with a Caesar Cypher. 
Users will be prompted for a number before the operation begins, this
number cooresponds to the shift. Another well developed tool was a find and 
replace function that currently replaces every single occurance of a phrase 
with one specified by the user.
